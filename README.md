# Optimizing school timetables with genetic algorithms

# TODOs
## Prettyprint final table (print_ent)
## Check fitness change every iteration and stop if it stagnates
Maybe something like: if the fitness changed less than 10 scores in the last 20 iterations stop 
## Cleanup: Remove legacy code, unused attributes, outcommented code and add new comments/structure
