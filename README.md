# Optimizing school timetables with genetic algorithms

# current state:


# TODOs
(number indicates priority)
## (0) Fix crossover
It currently somehow adds additional subjects(removing free slots) in the last class. See the freeslots statement. That's probably why it helps so much :) closes gaps and adds more prefered subjects :)
## (1) Benchmark setups of old/new mutation with/wo crossover and decide which ones are effective
## (2) Check wether precalculating fitness before sorting improves it. 
Laurent suspects it might not memo the result and calculates fitness nlogn times.
Question (by Lucas): fitness is never computed more than once for the same ent (bc of that fitness_cache dict in the fitness method). Ich verstehe nicht ganz was fitnesses vor dem sortieren vorberechnen bringen würde. Aber kann auch gut sein dass ich etwas übersehe ! 
## (3) Make mutation concentrate on unfit slots and classes
We mostly replace fit slots, which is not likely to improve the tables. This could be done by defining a slot- and class-local notion of fitness
## (3) Parametrize/diversify selection process
ideas:
### Make unfit tables mutate/crossover harder
### Check fitness change every iteration and stop if it stagnates
## (3) Check wether we can avoid some ent deepcopies
Maybe try to do elitism in place or smth. Might not be possible.
## (5) Type more expressions. give names to fields of ents etc
